#here are the remasking commands and accompanying library and RM.out file
#majority rule consensus sequences for LTR7B/C/Y (see library file) were made from sequences corresponding to nodes in the remaskdefinitions.png
	#to recreate, extract sequences from newick (../Trees_and_alignments)
#counts for remasking are in HERVH_LTRremasking.xlsx
	#note: these counts are post-OneCodeToFindThemAll.pl (see accompanying folder)
